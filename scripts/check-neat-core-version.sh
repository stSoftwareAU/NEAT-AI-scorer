# Gate against an unhandled breaking neat-core bump (Issue #252).
#
# scorer consumes neat-core through an UNPINNED `path` dependency that always
# tracks head (see `rust_scorer/Cargo.toml`). The path dep is kept by design
# (Round 2 decision), so the safeguard is this CI gate: it fails when the
# sibling neat-core presents a breaking bump scorer has not yet acknowledged,
# forcing a deliberate upgrade instead of tracking head blindly. This is what
# would have caught the neat-core #177 breaking type change before the build
# broke.
#
# Mechanism — version-baseline check:
#   * scorer records the last-handled neat-core version in the checked-in
#     `neat-core.expected-version` file.
#   * CI reads neat-core's actual version from the cloned sibling
#     `../NEAT-AI-core/Cargo.toml` ([workspace.package] version).
#   * The "breaking component" is the major for >= 1.0 releases and the minor
#     for pre-1.0 (0.x) releases, per SemVer. The gate FAILS when neat-core's
#     breaking component is greater than the recorded baseline; it PASSES on
#     patch-level drift (policy) and when the two match.
#
# "Handling" a breaking bump = a deliberate scorer PR that makes the
# corresponding code change AND bumps the recorded baseline to the new
# neat-core version.
#
# Usage:
#   check-neat-core-version.sh [--baseline PATH] [--core-manifest PATH]
#
# Defaults resolve the same paths Cargo uses: the baseline at the repo root and
# the neat-core workspace manifest at the sibling `../NEAT-AI-core/Cargo.toml`
# (the symlink CI creates makes this resolve on the runner too — see
# `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  versions are compatible (match, patch drift, or core behind baseline)
#   1  breaking neat-core bump above the recorded baseline — gate fails
#   2  usage / parse error (missing file, malformed version)

Usage: check-neat-core-version.sh [--baseline PATH] [--core-manifest PATH]

Options:
  --baseline PATH        File recording the last-handled neat-core version
                         (default: neat-core.expected-version at the repo root).
  --core-manifest PATH   neat-core workspace Cargo.toml carrying
                         [workspace.package] version (default: the sibling
                         ../NEAT-AI-core/Cargo.toml).
  -h, --help             Show this message.

Exits 0 when compatible, 1 on an unhandled breaking bump, 2 on a usage error.
